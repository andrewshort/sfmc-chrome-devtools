# Salesforce Marketing Cloud - Developer Tools (Google Chrome Extension)

## Introduction

### NOTE:

**This extension is neither an official porduct of Salesforce, nor in any way associated with Salesforce!** I'm just a software developer using Marketing Cloud on a daily basis and I'm sharing this extension I built for myself at start to help me with my daily work.

### Description

This is an extension of Google Chrome developer tools, that makes life easier for Salesforce Marketing Cloud users. Information that needs to be gathered by checking out all the network requests' responses or using workarounds like starting a wizard for a task you don't want to perform right now just to get the desired information isn't necessary anymore when using this extension.

However, this extension is currently being developed so the featureset will grow over time. If you have any questions, discovered bugs or just have an idea on how to improve this extension, feel free to raise an issue here on github.

## Features (v0.1)

### Gather Instance Information

If you open this extension and visit the Marketing Cloud Dashboard, basic information about the account and the currently logged in user is displayed. Furthermore the Marketing Cloud applications are shown along with the information if they are provisioned in this account and the current user is allowed to access them.

### Expose Publication List Ids

Adds the ids of your publication lists to the name column of the Publication List view in Email Studio. If you need the data for further programmatic use, an array of all publication lists including id, name and category is printed to the console. This is all as easy as clicking a button while being on the Publication Lists page in Email Studio. The console output looks like this:

`Publication Lists: [{"listId":1234,"categoryId":1234,"name":"Test"},{"listId":1235,"categoryId":1234,"name":"Test 2"}]`

### Display Data Extension Details

This feature helps displaying important information about your data extensions that isn't available without inspecting network requests or going to the details page of your data extension for example. Some of this can be useful if you need to develop custom entry events for example (e.g. an [event using transaction keys](https://github.com/mslabina/sfmc-customevent-with-transactionkey) to allow correct evaluation of multiple entries per subscriber). As soon as you navigate to the folder containing the data extensions you want to check, the data will be presented in the "Data Extension Details" tab.

### Expose Error Messages

Displays error messages, even the ones not shown in the user interface. Instead of having to fiddle around inspecting requests, the error-responses are displayed in a table in this extension. If the message is available in the actual response of the server, the error displyed in Salesforce Marketing Cloud (see figure 4) will be shown including the http-status, status-information and the given message (see figure 5). However, this only works if the error occured while having the devtools opened, so I highly recommended having this extension open everytime you are working with Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
